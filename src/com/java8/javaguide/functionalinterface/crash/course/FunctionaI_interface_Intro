	1.what is Functional Interface with an example?
		functional interface were introduced in java 8
		an interface which has exactly one abstract method is called as functional interface	
		functional interface it can have any number of static methods
		functional interface it can have any number of default methods
		we use java 8 @FunctionalInterface annotation mark an interface as a functional interface
		
		interface abc{
		//this is abstract method it can be only one in funInterface
		 void disp();
		}
		
	2.how to define functional interface using @functionalInterface
		1. Function --
				function interface is a functional interface
				it has a one parameter and it produces the result
		2. Consumer
				
			Consumer interface is a functional interface and generic interface and it take single type
			it represent  an operation that accept a single input argument and returns no result .unlike
			most others functional interface, consumer is expected to operate via side effects.
			 interface Function<String>  
			  
		3. Supplier Interface
			Supplier interface is the functional interface it can be use as the assignment target for 
			lambda expression or method reference
			it represent a supplier of result
			there is a no requirement  that a new or distinct result be returned each time the supplier is involved
			interface Supplier<T> 
			
		4. Runnable Interface
			Runnable interface is the functional interface
